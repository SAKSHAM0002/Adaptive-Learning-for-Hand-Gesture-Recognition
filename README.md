# Adaptive-Learning-for-Hand-Gesture-Recognition
This project explores an Active Learning approach using Empatica E4 accelerometer data and two additional datasets. It reduces annotation efforts while maintaining or surpassing the accuracy of a Personalized Model. Includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation scripts for benchmarking model performance across multiple datasets.
